                        <p>Our platform will act as a 24/7 active help and companion for women so that they don’t ever feel that they are alone in the middle of a crisis situation. It will unite and enable the citizens of India and the police to work towards a common problem. This tool will act as eyes and ears for the police and help them in preventing crimes against women. This tool has been designed in a manner that it covers the various situations a woman can be stuck in like when she is alone or when she is in a crowded place or when she is in a public transport etc.</p>
                        <p>The users need to register themselves on the app by creating their own account. This app service shall be a one-time registration, the users are required to fill in their basic details at the time of registration. After making an account user would be qualified to use all the services intended to protect and empower them. Services include an automated distress SOS to the nearest police station and to her emergency contacts, not only this the app will also automatically send in distress signals to the nearby people within a specified radius with a live location. We also look forward to ensure women safety in public transport, we propose that every public transport is it a bus, cab or an autorickshaw shall be fitted with a GPS device which will be monitored by the police at all times. On the user app, there will be a navigation drawer which shall hold the basic details of the user and the screen other than that shall hold only one big button which shall be the panic button/Emergency button.</p>
                        <p>On clicking this button the app sends in a distress message and a live location of the user to the nearest police station and to the ones selected as “close contacts”. The app will also send in a distress message and a live location link to all mobile phones then residing within a given radius from the location of the user. In case the user clicks the button while in a public transport, the system recognises the vehicle and marks it red on the map which is being monitored by the police. Navigation Drawer: The user can change their basic information and add/change their close contacts in this drawer.

                            The concerned authorities will be operating using a web portal where they shall have access to the digital map for user locations and to monitor public transport locations and shall be authorised to view the live CCTV footage of any vehicle at any point of time. Police can acknowledge their arrival to a user when a distress call arises in their watch.</p>
